# Unity-Dialogue-Model
Unity-Dialogue-Model is a project that uses Unity ML-Agents to create a conversational agent that interacts with the user via text. The project also adapts the Sorter example to make a type writer. The project is a fun and challenging way to learn and apply Unity ML-Agents and NLP techniques.
